yes, every weekend I am learning English and algorithms for work.

Last weekend, I was learning English and watching some TV shows, a Japanese movie and learning algorithms for my interview.

I like Japanese animation.

Next Wednesday is Singapore's public holiday. It is May 1 which is May Day.

If you get a long weekend like three or four days. What would you like to do?
