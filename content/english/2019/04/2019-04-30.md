Kevin:     Thanks for inviting me to your picnic last weekend. I had a lot of fun.

Dorothy:   She is from Colombia and has big eyes and curly hair. She is quite tall as well. You couldn’t have missed her.

Kevin:     Oh, yes! I remember talking to her. We had a long discussion about learning languages.

Kevin:     Indeed! Now I want to learn Spanish.
