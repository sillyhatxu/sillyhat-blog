Owner is the person who starts a company 
you could use document but usually we call it a research paper 
A document is more official 
For example, your company gives you documents about company policy 
But if you write a report about a problem, you could call it a paper 
Just remember, but you could also say remember without the just 
The just in that phrase isn't important.

## Lesson 26: Recommend Something

### DIALOGUE

> Dorothy and Kevin are talking about getting a new job.
  
```
Dorothy:   Kevin, I want to work for Cambly. Can you put in a good word for me?

Kevin:     Yes, I can. I know a lot of people that speak highly of you.

Dorothy:   Thanks, I appreciate it. Perhaps I should talk with the owners.

Kevin:     I highly recommend it.

Dorothy:   Maybe we could talk with them together?

Kevin:     That’s a good idea, but if I were you, I would talk to them by yourself first.

Dorothy:   Ok, I will. What about my resume? Can you give it to them?

Kevin:     I can, but I think it’s best that you to give it to them in person.

Dorothy:   I understand. Can you look at my resume first? Maybe you could recommend some changes to me.

Kevin:     I would be more than happy to do that for you. Just remember to be confident when you talk to the owners.
