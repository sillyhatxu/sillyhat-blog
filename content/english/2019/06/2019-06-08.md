## Conversation

```
You slept until 11:00. Memorized some words 
Coursera. 
permanent residence 
You want to apply for permanent residency in Singapore. 
You need to get some documents in China and when you return to Singapore you will apply for PR. 
The first application is difficult so many people are not successful, but on the second application more people are successful. 
Any country 
Switzerland 
an EU country 
but the problem with the EU is similar to the US because they are getting stricter about immigration 
scheme 
If I am successful 
That is your plan 
If a Singaporean goes to the US, it is not difficult if you are a software engineer 
I know some people that have gone to America 
scooter 
it's an electric scooter 
you scan the QR code 
Lime 
He is afraid that it can't be promoted because of the cost. 
I paid maybe 3 dollars for 5 minutes 
You split the cost four ways with the taxi but with the scooter you have to pay by yourself 
online 
forum 
like a what's app group 
welfare 
sharing information 
will become our goal 
that makes sense to have a group to share information 
the people that come first help the people that come later 
All of the company's employees are foreigners, but they all live in China 
misunderstanding about what 
they are called stereotypes 
like chinese know Kung Fu . All black people are good basketball players 
Every American is rich
