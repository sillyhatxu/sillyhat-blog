a free bit of advice 
Usually people don't like free advice because they haven't asked for it 
usually they are going to say something critical

speaks something 
when someone says something 
He speaks English 
When I speak something 
When I say something 
the man carries the woman's bag 
you call that being a gentleman 
Could you help her 
unless it is very heavy then the man often carries it 
if it is not heavy 
they talk about their own culture 
strange 
Because women feel like they can carry their own things and if the man carries them it means he thinks that they are weak

My wife advised me to stop smoking. If you were me what would you do?

## Lesson 27: Asking for Advice

### DIALOGUE

> Kevin and Dorothy are talking about asking for advice.
  
```
Kevin:     Dorothy, I need to ask you for some advice.

Dorothy:   Sure, how can I help you?

Kevin:     I am trying to decide whether to move to another city. If you were me, what would you do?

Dorothy:   I would listen to your family since they have to move with you. What does your family suggest?

Kevin:     I haven’t asked them yet. What do you advise me to do?

Dorothy:   You should have a family meeting. Your family will give you guidance.

Kevin:     Do you know what else I need to do to move? What would you suggest?

Dorothy:   I’m not sure what is the best way. Perhaps you need expert advice.

Kevin:     Yes, you’re right. I should find someone who has moved before, and ask them “What should I do?”

Dorothy:   Sometimes people may give you advice without you asking. For example, “here’s a free bit of advice“.
```
