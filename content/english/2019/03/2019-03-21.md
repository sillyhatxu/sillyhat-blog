> 21 Mar,2019 Tuesday

```
I was wake up in the morning at eight twenty. 

I was so tired that I didn't get up. 

I opened my eyes as usual to brush my teeth and then went to work. 

I went to breakfast before I remembered it that I forgot about my phone. 

So I don't have time to eat. I bought a loaf of bread and went back home. 

That is why I was late today. 

I don't know if I said it. I'm a software engineer. 

Did you see the like to my blog? This is a short connection I made myself.
