> 20 Mar,2019 Tuesday

```
I was wake up in the morning at eight o'clock. 

I opened my eyes as before. 

I put on my slippers and went to the bathroom brush my teeth. 

Do these sentences familiar to you? 

Yes, because I do it every day.  Maybe I will do it every day. 

What did we talk about right now? Oh, I said brush my teeth. 

Then I go to work at eight forty. I feel so tired because I'm very busy with my work. 

That's why I want to learn English. 

My dream is to work in a company that doesn't require overtime. 

If you see my diary, could you please tell me what is wrong?
