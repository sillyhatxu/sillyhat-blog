## Lesson 8: Working Late

### DIALOGUE

> Dorothy and Kevin are talking about their relatives.
  
```

Kevin:     Do you have any plans for this long holiday?

Dorothy:   I’ll be at a family reunion at my grandfather’s house. He usually invites all of us.

Kevin:     Oh! That’s nice. Where does he live?

Dorothy:   He has a ranch in the countryside of southern California. Everyone loves visiting his house because he has four horses and we can go horseback riding.

Kevin:     Wow, your grandfather sounds like an awesome person! How many relatives are coming to the reunion?

Dorothy:   Let’s see…It will be my family, my uncle’s family, my aunt’s family, and all of my cousins’ family. That’s more than 20 people. I can’t wait to see my newborn niece, Lily!

Kevin:     That’s a big reunion!

Dorothy:   Well, my grandfather is a very family-oriented man.

Kevin:     He sure is!

Dorothy:   I’m glad he is like this. I have so many good memories with my extended family.
