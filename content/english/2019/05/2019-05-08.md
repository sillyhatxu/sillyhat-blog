## Lesson 11: Weather in SF

### DIALOGUE

> Dorothy asks Kevin about the weather in San Francisco.
  
```
Dorothy:   It’s been very foggy and chilly in SF lately.

Kevin:     What’s the weather report for today?

Dorothy:   Hmm, let’s see. It’s 55 degrees and foggy.

Kevin:     That’s a bit chilly, but it’s the usual San Francisco weather. How’s the weather in LA?

Dorothy:   LA is much sunnier and warmer than SF. Today it’s 70 degrees.

Kevin:     Do you have enough warm clothes?

Dorothy:   I have a jacket, but I think I need more outerwear. I wonder if I should go shopping this weekend.

Kevin:     You should wear an extra layer that you can take off when it gets sunny and warm.

Dorothy:   I’m already doing that but sometimes it’s not enough. Maybe I’ll get a scarf.

Kevin:     That’s a good idea.
