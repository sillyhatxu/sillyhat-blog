## Lesson 22: Saying Sorry

### DIALOGUE

> Kevin and Dorothy are talking about saying sorry.
 
```
Kevin:      Dorothy, have you ever hurt someone’s feelings?

Dorothy:    Yes, I have. However, I always try to apologize when it’s my fault.

Kevin:      That’s good. Speaking of which, I’m sorry about missing dinner with your family.

Dorothy:    No worries. There’s nothing to be sorry for. You were busy.

Kevin:      Will you ask your family to please forgive me?

Dorothy:    I’m sure they will be happy to accept your apologies.

Kevin:      They’re good people. I just don’t want them to think I’m impolite.

Dorothy:    It’s not a problem. Why don’t you come to dinner this week?

Kevin:      I hope you pardon me again, but I’m not free this week either!

Dorothy:    No problem. We’ll excuse you.
