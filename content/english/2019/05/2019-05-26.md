## Lesson 28: Making Excuses

### DIALOGUE

> Kevin and Dorothy are talking about making excuses.
  
```
Kevin:    Dorothy, the other day a student didn’t hand in his homework. He gave me a lame excuse.

Dorothy:  What was his reason?

Kevin:    He said his dog ate it. I prefer when people are honest.

Dorothy:  I agree. Sometimes I mess up too, and then I start by saying, “I’m terribly sorry, but…”

Kevin:    The other day, my son made an excuse for not cleaning his room. He said, “I ran out of time.”

Dorothy:  I wanted to go to the movies the other day with my friend. But she said, “Sorry, I can’t afford to go.”

Kevin:    I asked my boss for a pay raise. He said, “I wish I could, but I can’t now.”

Dorothy:  I like when people give a good reason. For example, “I can’t go because I’m sick.”

Kevin:    Someday I will stop making excuses.

Dorothy:  I don’t think that’s possible.
```
