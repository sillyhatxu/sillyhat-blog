## Lesson 12: Dining Out

### DIALOGUE

> Kevin and Gina are at a seafood restaurant.
  
```
Waiter:  Good evening. Do you have a reservation with us today?

Kevin:   Yes, under the name Kevin, for two.

Waiter:  Right this way, sir.

Kevin:   Could I have the menu, please?

Waiter:  Certainly. Here is the menu, and a separate menu for drinks. Would you like some water to start with? Still or sparkling?

Kevin:   We will start with two glasses of still water first. Do you have any specials for today?

Waiter:  Our specials are clay pot cod and pan seared salmon. I would recommend tuna tartare for an appetizer if you are a fan of tuna.

Kevin:   That sounds very good. We’ll just start with that then.

Waiter:  Excellent choice. Would you like to order your entree now?

Kevin:   Give us a few more minutes to take a look at the menu. Thanks.
