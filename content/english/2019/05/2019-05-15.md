## Lesson 19: Different Cultures

### DIALOGUE

> Dorothy and Kevin are talking about the difference between cultures.
  
```
Dorothy:  Kevin, have you ever experienced culture shock?

Kevin:    Yes, I did when I lived in Thailand. They have different beliefs there. Most of the Thai people are Buddhists.

Dorothy:  I’m sure they have different values also.

Kevin:    One value they have in their religion is karma.

Dorothy:  I’ve heard of it. Do they stereotype other countries and people?

Kevin:    I think some people do, but I don’t let it bother me. Sometimes I had to watch my body language.

Dorothy:  That’s interesting. What about the Thai language. Are there different dialects?

Kevin:    Yes, it depends on which region you’re living in. In northern Thailand, they speak differently than people from Bangkok.

Dorothy:  How are their manners different?

Kevin:    They bow their head and put their hands together between the heart and face. It’s their cultural way of saying hi. It’s called wai.
